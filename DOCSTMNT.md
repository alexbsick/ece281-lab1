Documentation Statement: For this assignment, I worked with Major Seery who helped me understand VHDL code better and helped me out with my breadboard. I also referenced the VHDL Reference doc from Teams for the MUX implementation in Vivado. Finally, I checked my work with C3C Jake Miller, 
C3C John Costello and C3C Payton Nunn
